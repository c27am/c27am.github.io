	Today we coded from the back side of our computer to connect our websites to the web. We used github to connect them and coded on terminal to publish our websites.
</p>
<p2> 
	Journal entry #2 (9/22/2023) </p2> 

	<p> How to add things to my online version of my website. 
	
	<ol>
		<li>Open my terminal and navigate to my folder by typing cd ./desktop/c27am.github.io</li>

		<li>If I want to see if I added anything I can type <u> <b> git status</b></u> and it can show me my changes</li>

		<li>To add what I made I type <b> git add .</b></li>

		<li>Then I commit my changes and this means adding a little note that marks what I did so I say <b> git commit -m "whatever I did" </b></li>

	<p>
	 Today I worked on my birthday project and made it so that when I hover over one image it turns to another. I also added a table to my homepage so that the objects do not move when I am not in fullscreen mode. 
</p>
<p2>
Journal entry #4 (10/4/2023) <p2> 
	<p> Today I learned how to make an animation using percentes. I also learned how to make my texts be highlighted in different colors. 
</p>

Today I worked on my jumpscare project for Halloween. I used event listeners to make it so that when I click, an image displays. I did this through having the images opacity set at 0 but when the event listeners function is clicked the opacity becomes 100% so the image appears. 

My jumpscare is that when you click on an amazon box to "open" the box a cockroach comes running out. My second jumpscare is the crawling bug noise that is made when the cockroach appears making it sound like the bug is coming towards the screen. 

<ol>
<p> 3 questions about the event listeners video: 
</p>
		<li>How do you make it so that when pressing on different keys different things happen and is that possible? 
		</li>
	<li> How do you make it so that when you click on a certian place something plays?
	</li>
	<li>Can you have two things (one following your mouse and one being clicked to show its 100% opacity) linked to click at the same time?
</li>

	</ol>
</p>

	<p> Last class and today I have been working on my greatful/thanksgiving project. I used the event listener "click" and opacity so that when I click on the screen another image shows up. I also added click counter to equal 0 so that the images repeat if you continue to click. I was unable to find out how to make it so the image of the house disapears. I put images of what I am greatful for such as my dad, mom, brother, food and shelter. 
</p>

<p2> Journal entry #7 (12/1/2023) <p2>
<p> This class I made a variable that connects to a div, learned how to use the function "createElement" and then used "appendChild" to create an image. Also then we used counter to make the number of images more than one and less than three, which made 2 images. I also used "ball.innerText = input" to make numbers on each image. I wanted mine to be a data tracking type of thing so I chose to display the numbers of communtiy service I have done so far.

The past few classes I worked on a cookie decorating project. First I made divs for each topping and putting them under the same class so that they would all be the same size. Then I used javascript to make a variable called topping and a function called maketopping. I used an event listener to make it so that when my mouse clicks on a topping image, the image goes to where I clicked using another Eventlistener which has the function of topping, making it so that my toppings show up in the topping class. Instead of writing document.addEventListener, I said cookie (the name of my div with the image of a cookie) so that you can only put images/toppings on the cookie.

		<p> I have been working on my holiday card. A few people in my PL group decided to make our holiday cards for our PLs so I used my cookie decorater code but changed it a little bit. Using my code the I used for my cookie decorater, I changed the images to oranments of my PLs and I changed the cookie to a Christmas tree. When you click on the ornament image and then click on a place on the tree, it generates another div with the same style as the ornament. However, whenever I click on the tree the image generates but not by my mouse, it appears to be 50 left and 50px top away from my mouse. I tried changing the code but I still do not understand how to make it click right where my mouse was. This issue also occurs with my cookie decorater.

<p> Today we worked on randomly generating things. First I used var to genrate three words. I am making a rock paper scissors game so I wrote: rock, paper, scissors. Then I used math random to randomly generate one out of three items.  I then used console log so that it would show the random item selected in the console. After that I used document.innertext and an event listener to make it so when one clicks on the screen the text of random item appears on the screen. </p>

<p2> Journal Entry #11 (01/24/2024)</p2> 
<p> Recently I have been working on using arrays to make a picture generating card for my mom. I used an event listener and array so that when you click a random photo out of 14 photos are generated. </p> 

<p2> Journal Entry #12 (02/21/2024) <p2> 
	<p> Today we learned about color in computers. We started by learning about rgba. The r stands for red, g stands for green, b stands for blue and a stands for alpha. We coded using a event listener so that when you click on the page it changes colors. </p> 

<p2> Journal Entry #13 (2/23/2024) <p2> 
	<p> Questions about color: 
		<li> 
			1. What are the colors that we do not see and are there special glasses to see them? 
			2. Do some animals not see color? 
			3.
