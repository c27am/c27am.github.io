	Journal entry #1 (9/20/2023) - Today we coded from the back side of our computer to connect our websites to the web. We used github to connect them and coded on terminal to publish our websites.
</p>
<p> 
	Journal entry #2 (9/22/2023) - How to add things to my online version of my website. 
	<ol>
		<li>Open my terminal and navigate to my folder by typing cd ./desktop/c27am.github.io</li>

		<li>If I want to see if I added anything I can type <u> <b> git status</b></u> and it can show me my changes</li>

		<li>To add what I made I type <b> git add .</b></li>

		<li>Then I commit my changes and this means adding a little note that marks what I did so I say <b> git commit -m "whatever I did" </b></li>

		<li> to finsh it off and put my changes online I type git push</li>
	</ol>

	Journal entry #3 (10/1/2023) - Today I worked on my birthday project and made it so that when I hover over one image it turns to another. I also added a table to my homepage so that the objects do not move when I am not in fullscreen mode. 
</p>
<p>
Journal entry #4 (10/4/2023) - Today I learned how to make an animation using percentes. I also learned how to make my texts be highlighted in different colors. 
</p>

<p>
Journal entry #5 (10/29/2023) - Today I worked on my jumpscare project for Halloween. I used event listeners to make it so that when I click, an image displays. I did this through having the images opacity set at 0 but when the event listeners function is clicked the opacity becomes 100% so the image appears. 

My jumpscare is that when you click on an amazon box to "open" the box a cockroach comes running out. My second jumpscare is the crawling bug noise that is made when the cockroach appears making it sound like the bug is coming towards the screen. 

<ol>
<p> 3 questions about the event listeners video: 
</p>
		<li>How do you make it so that when pressing on different keys different things happen and is that possible? 
		</li>
	<li> How do you make it so that when you click on a certian place something plays?
	</li>
	<li>Can you have two things (one following your mouse and one being clicked to show its 100% opacity) linked to click at the same time?
</li>

	</ol>
</p>

<p>
	Journal entry #6 (11/17/2023) - Last class and today I have been working on my greatful/thanksgiving project. I used the event listener "click" and opacity so that when I click on the screen another image shows up. I also added click counter to equal 0 so that the images repeat if you continue to click. I was unable to find out how to make it so the image of the house disapears. I put images of what I am greatful for such as my dad, mom, brother, food and shelter. 
</p>

<p> Journal entry #7 (12/1/2023) -  This class I made a variable that connects to a div, learned how to use the function "createElement" and then used "appendChild" to create an image. Also then we used counter to make the number of images more than one and less than five, which made 4 images. I also used "ball.innerText = input" to make numbers on each image. I wanted mine to be a data tracking type of thing so I chose to display the average hours I spend on my phone per day.
